# tictactoeAI
This is a simple tictactoe game that pits a human player 
against the computer.
The AI follows a simple heuristic function to make a move.
To play efficiently, all possible gameboard configurations
are stored in a tree. Nodes in the tree are used to
check the game status(win, loose or draw).
The game is written in C++17. To play, download the code 
and compile with a C++17 enabled compiler.
